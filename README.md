# yenile

A bash script to update both macOS and Homebrew. macOS has a native CLI to fetch system updates that's faster than the conventional method, which this script takes advantage of.

2. Open Terminal
3. `cd` to script's path and move it to the binary path: `mv yenile /usr/local/bin`
4. Make your script executable: `chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/yenile`
